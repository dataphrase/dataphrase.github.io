## Introduction
Have you ever wondered what may have lead to the discovery of the 'handwashing'?

Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. Dr. Semmelweis was feeling disturbed when he was thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He was thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth died from it.

 He was thinking about it because he knew the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

 Let's look at the data and try to make sense of it.

## Loading and understanding the data

 We have 2 files. The first one,yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv, has yearly report of total births and deaths for the years 1841 to 1846 and for 2 different clinics. The second file, monthly_deaths.csv, has the births and deaths for each month from year 1841 to 1949 for Clinic 1.

 Let's load the data:
```python
 import pandas as pd
 yearly = pd.read_csv("datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv")

 monthly = pd.read_csv("datasets/monthly_deaths.csv", parse_dates=["date"])
```

First, let's print the yearly data.This is what we get:

The table above shows the number of women giving birth at the two clinics at the Vienna General Hospital for the years 1841 to 1846. You'll notice that an alarming number of women died as the result of childbirth, most of them from childbed fever.

To see this more clearly, we can plot  the values. But before that, we can calculate the deaths to births ratio and separate the data for 2 clinics:
```python
# Calculate proportion of deaths per no. births
yearly["proportion_deaths"] = yearly["deaths"] / yearly["births"]

# Extract clinic 1 data into yearly1 and clinic 2 data into yearly2
yearly1 = yearly[yearly["clinic"] == "clinic 1"]
yearly2 = yearly[yearly["clinic"] == "clinic 2"]


# This makes plots appear in the notebook
%matplotlib inline

# Plot yearly proportion of deaths at the two clinics
ax = yearly1.plot(x="year", y="proportion_deaths", label="yearly1")
yearly2.plot(x="year", y="proportion_deaths", label="yearly2", ax = ax)
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/handwash/2.PNG" alt="plot of yearly data">

Clearly, there is a huge difference between the death proportions of the 2 clinics. Definetly something wrong was happening in Clinic 1.
Dr. Semmelweis found put that there was only one difference between the 2 clinics:
medical students served at Clinic 1, while mostly midwife students served at Clinic 2.
While the midwives only tended to the women giving birth, the medical students also spent time in the autopsy rooms examining corpses.

Semmelweis started to suspect that something on the corpses, spread from the hands of the medical students, caused childbed fever. So in a desperate attempt to stop the high mortality rates, he decreed: Wash your hands! This was an unorthodox and controversial request, nobody in Vienna knew about bacteria at this point in time.

## Effect of handwashing
In 1847, Semmelweis made handwashing obligatory. That's when there was a drop in the death proportions. Let's explore the monthly data for Clinic 1.

```python
# Date when handwashing was made mandatory
handwashing_start = pd.to_datetime('1847-06-01')

# Split monthly into before and after handwashing_start
before_washing = monthly[monthly["date"] < handwashing_start]
after_washing = monthly[monthly["date"] >= handwashing_start]

# Plot monthly proportion of deaths before and after handwashing
ax = before_washing.plot(x="date", y="proportion_deaths", label="before_washing")
after_washing.plot(x="date", y="proportion_deaths", label="after_washing", ax=ax)
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/handwash/3.PNG" alt="monthly data">

Again, the graph shows that handwashing had a huge effect.

 How much did it reduce the monthly proportion of deaths on average?
 ```python
 # Difference in mean monthly proportion of deaths due to handwashing
 before_proportion = before_washing["proportion_deaths"]
 after_proportion = after_washing["proportion_deaths"]
 mean_diff = after_proportion.mean() - before_proportion.mean()
 mean_diff
 # output: -0.08395660751183336
 ```
It reduced the proportion of deaths by around 8 percentage points! From 10% on average to just 2% (which is still a high number by modern standards).

So, do not forget to wash your hands.

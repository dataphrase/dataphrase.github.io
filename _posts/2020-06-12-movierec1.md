## Introduction

This blog series is about a project, [Movie recommendation system](https://movie-recommendations-system.herokuapp.com/) built by [Manan Jhaveri](https://dataphrase.github.io/about/#manan-jhaveri) and [Devanshu Ramaiya](https://dataphrase.github.io/about/#devanshu-ramaiya). In Part 1 of the series, we talk about how we scraped data from the IMDb website. So, let's begin!

## Target

Get 1000+ movies' data from IMDb. The dataset should include title, summary, genre and year.

## Importing relevant packages

First step is to import relevant packages. If you don't have any of these packages, you can always use pip to install them.

```python
  import requests

  import re

  import pandas as pd

  import numpy as np

  from requests_html import HTML
```

## Scraping data

The first step is to declare empty lists for title, genre, summary and year.

```python
  titles = []
  summary = []
  year = []
  genre = []
```
Next, we need a variable called page which will be responsible to switch to the next page of the [website](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&num_votes=10000,&countries=us&sort=user_rating,desc&start=1&ref_=adv_nxt) as on one page there are 50 movies. For me to explain further, I need you to have a look at the code first.

```python
genre_master = ["drama", "comedy", "romance", "horror", "action", "sci-fi", "sport", "fantasy", "crime", "music", "war", "biography", "thriller", "mystery", "family", "animation" ]

for i in range(1):

  page = 1

  while(page < 4002):

    x = str(page)

    url = r"https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&num_votes=10000,&countries=us&sort=user_rating,desc&start=" + x +"&ref_=adv_nxt"

    r = requests.get(url)

    html_text = r.text

    r_html = HTML(html = html_text)

    r_title = r_html.find("h3 a")

    r_summary = r_html.find("p")

    r_year_genre = r_html.find("span")

    try:
      titles = titles + [r_title[x].text for x in range(0,50)]

      summary = summary + [r_summary[x].text for x in range(1,201, 4)]  

    except:

      break

    # Extracting year and genre from r_year_genre
    for i in range(len(r_year_genre)):

        temp = re.findall("\d+", r_year_genre[i].text)

        if (r_year_genre[i].text.split(", ")[0]).lower() in genre_master:
          genre.append(r_year_genre[i].text)          

        elif (len(temp) > 0 and len(temp[0]) == 4):
          year.append(temp[0])

    page = page + 50
```
I know, at first glance, its not easy to understand this. But let's go step by step: -

1. That for loop is just used to run the snippet once, nothing special.
2. After that page is equal to 1, that part is explained above. In the while loop, the condition says page < 4002, that is just because we didn't want to extract all the movies, just a few. You'll get to know the number in the end, if you want you can calculate as well, remember, one page has 50 movies.
3. The "x" in the URL represents page number, that's how we can switch pages.
4. The next 6 lines are crucial. We use the requests package to first get the page of that URL. Next, we extract the HTML of that page by using r.text and then pass that to the HTML method to identify all the HTML tags. If you look at the HTML code extracted, the tag "h3 a" will fetch you the movie title, "p" tag will give you the summary and "span" will give you year and genre. To look at how we found this, simply go to the [URL](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&num_votes=10000,&countries=us&sort=user_rating,desc&start=1&ref_=adv_nxt), right click on the movie title and click on inspect.
5. try and except clause is used to extract title and summary and if it goes to the except part that means no more movies are left.
6. For extracting year and genre from r_year_genre, we need to use regular expression. '\d+' in regex terms means that we are looking for one or more digits. So, we find everything which has one or more digits and then extract the text from that and store it in temp. The if else statement is used to separate year and genre. If you split and find a genre which is in genre_master (list of all genres), then we add that to the genre list else if temp's length is greater than 0 and len(temp[0]) is equal to 4, that means its a year (example: 2014), hence that will be put in year list.
7. Last step is to update the page variable so that when the while loop is executed again, it switches to the next page.

## Storing data

Now, its easy, just store all this in a dataframe and convert that dataframe into an excel file. But, you need to be carfeul about duplicates as a movie can have multiple genres. Hence we drop the duplicates from the dataframe before converting it into an excel file.

```python
  df = pd.DataFrame({"titles": titles, "summary": summary, "genre": genre, "year": year})
  df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True, ignore_index=True)
  df.to_excel("imdb_movie_summary.xlsx")
```
Here's the result, have a look at the first 5 records of the file: -

## Conclusion

Those who were curious about the number of movies in our dataset, its 4049. So, this is how we scraped data from IMDb. In the next part, we will describe how we used Natural Language Processing to generate recommendations. Till then, you can use our [web app](https://movie-recommendations-system.herokuapp.com/) to get recommendations for your next watchlist!

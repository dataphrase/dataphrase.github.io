## Introduction

In the previous post, we saw how to prepare our database by web scraping the IMDb website. Now, we will see how to use basic Natural Language Processing techniques to prepare a Movie-Recommendation system.

## Importing Packages and downloading necessary items

We will be using nltk.stem.WordNetLeammatizer to Lemmatize the words in the movie summary after removing English stop-words from nltk library.
We will also have to download the English stop-words, wordnet(for lemmatization), etc.

```python
import pandas as pd
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline


nltk.download("stopwords")
nltk.download("punkt")
nltk.download("wordnet")
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

```

If you've forgotten, this is what the database looks like -

## Cleaning the text

In order to remove unnecessary information, we will create a function that cleans the text.

```python
def clean_text(text):
  tokens = word_tokenize(text)
  tokens_transformed = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(t.lower()) for t in tokens if t not in stop_words]
  s = ""
  for t in tokens_transformed:
    s = s + t + " "
  return s
```

This function transforms the summary by excluding stop-words and lemmatizing the other words.

Stop-words are words which add very little meaning, such as "the", "a", "an", etc.

Lemmatization means removing inflectional parts of the words to reduce them to the base form(known as lemma).


## Converting text to numbers

```python
def make_df():

    #1
    df_original = pd.read_excel("imdb_movie_summary.xlsx")

    #2
    df["transformed_summary"] = df["summary"].apply(clean_text)    

    #3
    tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()  
    model = NMF(n_components = 100)
    pipeline = make_pipeline(tfidf, model)

    df_transformed = pd.DataFrame(pipeline.fit_transform(df.transformed_summary), index = df.titles)


    #4
    genre_master = ["drama", "comedy", "romance", "horror", "action", "sci-fi", "sport", "fantasy", "crime", "music", "war", "biography", "thriller", "mystery", "family", "animation", "adventure", "musical", "history", "western", "film-noir" ]
    genre_dict = {"drama": 1, "comedy": 2, "romance": 3, "horror": 4, "action": 5, "sci-fi": 6, "sport":7, "fantasy": 8, "crime":  9, "music": 10, "war": 11, "biography": 12, "thriller": 13, "mystery": 14, "family": 15, "animation": 16, "adventure": 17, "musical": 18, "history": 19, "western": 20, "film-noir": 21}
    full = []
    for g in df.genre:
      g = g.lower()
      ind = [genre_dict.get(x) for x in g.split(", ")]
      temp = []
      for i in range(1, len(genre_master) + 1):
        if i in ind:
          temp.append(1)
        else:
          temp.append(0)
      full.append(temp)

      df_genre = pd.DataFrame(full, columns = genre_master, index = df.titles)


      #5
      scaler = Normalizer()
      df_combined = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(pd.concat([df_transformed, df_genre], axis = 1)), index = df.titles)


    return df_combined
```

Let's understand this part step-by-step:

1. We will import the database we prepared and save it in a DataFrame.

2. Then, the clean_text() function is applied on the summaries of movies.

3. This is part converts the text to numeric representation. A pipeline is made containing TfidfVectorizer() and NMF().

  - TfidfVectorizer() - It stands for â€œTerm Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency". It tokenizes the documents and returns a sparse matrix with words frequencies.

  - NMF() - NMF stands for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization. It returns a matrix which is a low-dimensional form of the input matrix. Basically, a dimensionality reduction technique.

4. Now, each movie is represented by a vector. This is saved in df_transformed. Genres in our database are still in text form. We will extract the Genres from each sample and binary-encode it. This is will be saved in df_genre.

5. A final DataFrame is formed by combining df_transformed and df_genre and scaled it row-wise by using Normalizer(). Let's say this is now stored in df_final.

## Generating Recommendations

The Recommendations here are based on the similarity in summary and genres. We have a matrix representing movies in the form of vectors(numbers, to put it simply).
We will use a simple method to compare similarities: dot product.
The dot product of the vector of the movie which is entered and df_final.

(it is required that the movie entered is a part of the database)

```python
key = df_final.loc[movie]
scores = df_final.dot(key)
rec_list = list(scores.nlargest(11).index)
```
(before this step, index of df_final was changed to movie titles to use .loc)

Here, "key" is the vector representation of the movie entered.

"Scores" has the dot product.

".nlargest()" function gives us the n most similar movies.
(similar movies will have a greater dot product)

And, that's it. Print the rec_list and you will find the top similar movies from the database.  

## Conclusion
So, we have now made a simple Recommendation system using basic NLP techniques. You can now create your own database and launch a web app which use these techniques to generate recommendations.

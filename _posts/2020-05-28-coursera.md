## Introduction
I was really fascinated by this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset) and hence wanted to apply data visualization techniques to learn more from data. Okay, let's start. First we need to import the necessary packages.

```python
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  %matplotlib inline
  import seaborn as sns
```
Next, we need to read the csv file and just look at the top 5 rows and info.

```python
  data = pd.read_csv('coursea_data.csv')
  print(data.shape)
  data.head()
```

## Data pre-preprocessing
First, we need to rename Unnamed: 0 column to Id.

```python
  # replacing Unnamed: 0 column with Id
  data['Id'] = data['Unnamed: 0']
  data.drop(['Unnamed: 0'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```
As you can see that the column course_students_enrolled is of the type object. That is due to the "k" or "m" after the number. We need to deal with that before starting any analysis.

```python
  std_enroll = []
  for i in range(0, len(data)):
    try:
        num = data['course_students_enrolled'].str.split('k')[i][0]
        num = float(num) * 1000
        std_enroll.append(num)
    except:
        num = data['course_students_enrolled'].str.split('m')[i][0]
        num = float(num) * 1000000
        std_enroll.append(num)
  data['course_students_enrolled'] = std_enroll
  data['course_students_enrolled'] = data['course_students_enrolled'].astype(float)
```
Now, we can start with data visualization!

## Which organization has the most number of courses?
Here, we want to check two things. First, which organization has the most number of courses on Coursera. Next, which all organizations have more than 10 courses on coursera. This is just a basic analysis which could show the organizations which dominate on Coursera.

```python
  def find_org_greater_than_10(data):
      """Returns a dataframe with course_organization and number of courses > 10"""
      dict = {}
      course_org = data['course_organization'].to_list()
      for org in course_org:
          if org in dict:
              dict[org] += 1
          else:
              dict[org] = 1
      orgs = []
      counts = []
      for key, value in dict.items():
          if value > 10:
              orgs.append(key)
              counts.append(value)
          else:
              continue
      course_org_greater_than_1 = pd.DataFrame({'course_organization':orgs, 'count':counts})
      course_org_greater_than_1.sort_values(by='count', ascending=False, inplace=True)
      return course_org_greater_than_1

      # function call
      course_org_greater_than_1 = find_org_greater_than_10(data)

      # plot a barh chart
      course_org_greater_than_1.plot(kind='barh', x='course_organization', y='count')
      plt.title('Organizations with more than 10 courses')
      plt.xlabel('count')
      plt.show()
```

University of Pennsylvania dominates here, with just about 60 courses, followed University of Michigan who has just over 40 courses on Coursera!

## Average course rating of the organizations with more than 10 courses
Here, we want to see whether these organizations produce quality courses or is it just quantity over quality?

```python
  # dictionary containing organization as key and avg rating as value
  dom_dict = round(data.groupby('course_organization')['course_rating'].mean(), 1).to_dict()

  # Filter out organizations, as we only want those organizations with more than 10 courses
  orgs = course_org_greater_than_1['course_organization'].to_list()
  avg_rating = []
  for org in orgs:
      for key, value in dom_dict.items():
          if key == org:
              avg_rating.append(value)
          else:
              continue
  course_org_greater_than_1['avg_rating'] = avg_rating

  # plot a barh chart
  course_org_greater_than_1.plot(kind='barh', x='course_organization', y='avg_rating')
  plt.title('Average course rating of organizations with more than 10 courses')
  plt.xlabel('Average course rating')
  plt.show()
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera_blog/graph_2.PNG" alt="Horizontal bar plot">

As you can see, there is a very little difference between the average course rating of all these organizations. Hence, they don't focus on just quantity.

## Which organization has the highest course rating?
What do you think? Will the organization with highest course rating have more than 10 courses?

```python
  dom_dict = data.groupby('course_organization')['course_rating'].mean().to_dict()
  dom_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(dom_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)}
  for key, value in dom_dict.items():
    if value == 4.9:
        print(key)
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera_blog/out_1.PNG" alt="Output key">

As you can see, none of these organizations belong to that group who have more than 10 courses.

## Top 10 courses on Coursera
Let's look at the top 5 courses on Coursera by course rating

```python
  course_dict = data.groupby('course_title')['course_rating'].mean().to_dict()
  course_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(course_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)}
  cour_df = pd.DataFrame({'course_title':list(course_dict.keys()), 'course_rating':list(course_dict.values())})
  print(cour_df[:10])
```

## Does course difficulty affect number of students enrolled?
For this we will check the average number of students enrolled grouping by difficulty.

```python
  stud_dict = round(data.groupby('course_difficulty')['course_students_enrolled'].mean(), 0).to_dict()
  stud_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(stud_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)}
  diff_stud = pd.DataFrame({'difficulty':list(stud_dict.keys()), 'avg_students':list(stud_dict.values())})
  diff_stud.plot(kind='bar', x='difficulty', y='avg_students', title='Distribution by difficulty')
  plt.ylabel('Number of students')
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera_blog/graph_3.PNG" alt="Distribution by difficulty">

Well, there are more number of students enrolled per Mixed difficulty level course rather than Beginner.

## Does course difficulty affect rating?
Do courses with advanced level of difficulty get lower rating? Is there any relation between the two?

```python
  rate_dict = round(data.groupby('course_difficulty')['course_rating'].mean(), 1).to_dict()
  rate_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(rate_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)}
  diff_stud['avg_rating'] = list(rate_dict.values())
  diff_stud.plot(kind='bar', x='difficulty', y='avg_rating', title='Average rating by difficulty')
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera_blog/graph_4.PNG" alt="Average rating by difficulty">

Nope, very less difference in the ratings.

## Does certificate type impact number of students enrolled?
This could be a very important question for Coursera and for the organizations who are making courses. What type of certificate should be there for maximum student enrollment and how should Coursera optimize the course recommendations based on the type of certificates?

```python
  cert_dict = round(data.groupby('course_Certificate_type')['course_students_enrolled'].mean(), 0).to_dict()
  cert_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(cert_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)}
  cert_df = pd.DataFrame({'course_Certificate_type':list(cert_dict.keys()), 'avg_students':list(cert_dict.values())})
  cert_df.plot(kind='bar', x='course_Certificate_type', y='avg_students', title='Distribution by course_Certificate_type')
  plt.ylabel('Number of students')
  plt.show()
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera_blog/graph_5.PNG" alt="Distribution by course_Certificate_type">

## Does certificate type impact course rating?
Do professional certificates have a higher rating because they are accepted everywhere or is there still no impact?

```python
  rate_cert_dict = round(data.groupby('course_Certificate_type')['course_rating'].mean(), 1).to_dict()
  rate_cert_dict = {k: v for k, v in sorted(rate_cert_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)}
  cert_df['avg_rating'] = list(rate_cert_dict.values())
  cert_df.plot(kind='bar', x='course_Certificate_type', y='avg_rating', title='Average rating by certificate type')
  plt.ylabel('Number of students')
  plt.show()
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera_blog/graph_6.PNG" alt="Average rating by certificate type">

## Number of students enrolled vs. course rating
Last but not the least, if there a large number of students enrolled in your course, does that impact the course rating?

```python
  data.plot(kind='scatter', x='course_students_enrolled', y='course_rating', title='Number of students enrolled vs. course rating')
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera_blog/graph_7.PNG" alt="Number of students enrolled vs. course rating">

There is a small datapoint at the bottom which says that less number of students meaning low rating, but this does not prove our assumption as there is no strong relation. We can check how strong is the relation by finding correlation between the two.

```python
  print(data.corr())
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coursera_blog/corr.PNG" alt="Correlation table">

You see, there is a very small positive correlation, hence its not enough to prove our assumption that more number of students enrolled in your course does lead to higher rating.

## Conclusion
- University of Pennsylvania has most number of courses on Coursera followed by University of Michigan.
- Organizations with more than 10 courses on Coursera are not present in the top 5 organizations list with highest rating.
- There is no Computer Science course in the top 10 highest rated courses on Coursera. (Please prove me wrong!)
- Course difficulty does affect the number of students enrolled. There are more students enrolled in Beginner and Mixed level of difficulty courses than Intermediate and Advanced.
- Course difficulty does not affect course rating.
- Course certificate type does impact the number of students enrolled in that course. More number of students tend to enroll for Professional Certificate courses than just "COURSE" certificate.
- Certificate type does not impact course rating.
- There is no strong relation to prove that if more number of students are enrolled in a course, the course rating is a higher.
